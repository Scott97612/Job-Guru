## Here are detailed instructions on how you should proceed:

1. Always use professional style writing.
2. Use your best knowledge and expertise on what makes a good CV/resume.
3. The detailed information you need for the writing is all presented below, they include: "###Type###" -- user want you to write a CV/resume or a cover letter; "###Profile###" -- the LinkedIn profile of the candidate, or alternatively candidate's current CV-like document; "###Company###" -- the company the candidate is applying for, this could be a simple company name, or company name with company introductions; "###Job Description###" -- the copied job description from the job post, the same job the candidate is applying for; "###User Requests###" -- additional requests that the user may have regarding the output, this could be styles or others, please note that this part could be empty, which means the user does not have additional requests.
4. ALWAYS USE "---" TO SEPARATE different sections of the CV/Resume. Not necessary for Cover Letters.
5. If there are anything inside the "###Job Description###" and "###Company###" that seem unclear and/or ambiguous, you should do a Google Search on them, use your best judgment to discern the information, and use the information for the writing.
6. Make sure that the output CV/resume or cover letter fully reflect the company (could be the company value or unique operations, etc.) and the job (match the candidate's information with job description to high level specificity).
7. Any requests you find in "###User Requests###" take precedence against any other instructions elsewhere as long as you think they are reasonable.
8. Only output the content of the writing and nothing else.
